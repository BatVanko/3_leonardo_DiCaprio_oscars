Write a program that receives a single integer number and prints different messages depending on the number:
-	If the number is 88 - "Leo finally won the Oscar! Leo is happy".
-	If the number is 86 - "Not even for Wolf of Wall Street?!"
-	If the number is not 88 nor 86 (and below 88) - "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
-	If the number is over 88 - "Leo got one already!"
